# TypeRacer
This repository consistes of a JS (JavaScrpit) file that can be used to check the TypeRacer's typing algorithms.
Do Note that this is only for testing purposes and the JS Script hereafter used is of a noble man who I don't know the name of!
**I've done subtle changes to the Script so that the _TypreRacer website dosen't gives you a "CAPTCHA"_ to Solve**
However if you want to solve the CAPTCHA (as you have God Level Typing Skills) then you should lower down the number in the last few lines of the JS.
**By default the setTimeout**
It is set to 220, if user decreases it then the script will type fatser and vice-versa.

__Do rememebr to paste this file in your "Console" that is found inside the Inspect Tab__
and hit "ENTER" only when the countdown ends (otherwise it will not work)
**Do Remember to Place the last punctuation in the end of the line to end the TEST**
